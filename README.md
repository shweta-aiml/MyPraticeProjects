This file contains a simple implementation of KNN algorithm using IRIS dataset.

Iris dataset has been imported from sklearn and has the following features. 
  1.150 instances
  2.3 classes with 50 instances
  3.Data attributes are : species 
                        sepal length(cms)
                        sepal width(cms)
                        petal length(cms)
                        petal width(cms)
  4. Species are - 
          a)iris versicolor
          b)iris setosa
          c)iris virginica
  
  Solution reads the iris datasets, seperates features and targets . Implements KNN model .
  Predict the accuracy and then test the model with set of values.
