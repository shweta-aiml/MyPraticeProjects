My Practice Projects contains 2 projects

1. KNN_Iris implements KNN in iris dataset 
        This file contains a simple implementation of KNN algorithm using IRIS dataset.

        Iris dataset has been imported from sklearn and has the following features. 
          1.150 instances
          2.3 classes with 50 instances
          3.Data attributes are : species 
                                sepal length(cms)
                                sepal width(cms)
                                petal length(cms)
                                petal width(cms)
          4. Species are - 
                  a)iris versicolor
                  b)iris setosa
                  c)iris virginica

          Solution reads the iris datasets, seperates features and targets . Implements KNN model .
          Predict the accuracy and then test the model with set of values. 
2.Predicting Breast Cancer _Using KNN implement the solution of the project 
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

I will be implementing more solutions for this  problem.
